## what is the Problem we are solving?
- books are in declining phase ,now a days  people prefer watching videos, which  are few minutes long, so the amount of time which should be given to the while learning concepts
- If we search for reviews we end up getting spoilers for novels
- Some time we only see one or two reviews which don’t gives whole idea about that

# how we Solved?

- We made a webapp in which we can get to know about the engagement of Book with respect to its progress before hand…
But users wont to provide feedback for every single page so how we did that ?
We used webcam and AI which calculates the useful features from facial expression in real time and stored in Real time database

## what else ?
- If readers want to know more about a certain paragraph they can simply click on that. This opens a popup with some reference links to the topics which are extracted from that paragraph.

## future plans
- We will also be adding text-to-audio feature so that we can also reach blinds. We are looking forward to add IVR calling for those who don’t have access to internet. We are also looking forward to add translations so that we can target regional populations as well.
